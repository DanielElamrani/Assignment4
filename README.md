In this assignment we were tasked with creating a report given a data file containing movie titles, release year and genre.
As with the last few assignments, commas have been dealt with via find and replace. To extract the data from the file I first read in
the data to a 2D array. From there I was able to extract the movie title and release year as well as the genre. I looped through my 2D
array and each time I created a MovieObject which held the movie name, release year and genres. I then created a method to print a report.

This report would print how many movies were in each genre and whether each genre was above or below the average amount of 
movies were in each genre. The report also included how many movies were in each genre in the last 5 years. In addition, I printed out
how many movies were in each genre per decade starting from the 1900's all the way up to now. 

I accomplished this through a series of if statements. 

The code is well commented and explains my thinking and the technical details.
